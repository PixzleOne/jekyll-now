Hello again!
This week I've been working a bit on the cave shooter, let's just call it **Mega Cave Goat** for now. 
"Why Mega Cave Goat?" you might ask, but that's a story for another day.

I added some better art, but there is still a LOT of work to be done. Anyways here's what that looks like at the moment.

The reason I've not made a lot of progress is because I decided to join the GDL Area 51 jam, so I've been working on that this weekend. That means I'm taking a break from MCG (Mega Cave Goat) for now.

It's a game about a little alien who wants to save abducted humans. It's inpired by VVVVVV in a pretty weird and stupid way. Here's what it looks like:

That's all I have for this week! Bye! o/
